Your task this week is to find more efficient ways to guide Sammy the Spartan on the optimal path in his quest in bigger and more complex mazes.

In addition to dfs, bfs and ucs, the main program (spartanquest.py) now allows you to specify astar as the search algorithm.

	python spartanquest.py sjsu.txt astar

**Note that if you do not specify a heuristic, the program defaults to the trivial heuristic, null_heuristic.**

null_heuristic is implemented for you in informed_search.py.

**You can also specify a heuristic:**

	python spartanquest.py sjsu.txt astar gen_heuristic

Your task is to help Sammy the Spartan find the optimal path more efficiently by implementing the following:

1. **A* graph search algorithm.** Fill in your code in the function **astar** in the Python module informed_search.py.
Note that if you run A* with the null heuristic, you should get the same results as with the uniform cost search:

	*python spartanquest.py sjsu.txt astar null_heuristic*
		Path length: 52
		Path cost: 144
		Number of nodes expanded: 553

2. A simple heuristic, based on the Manhattan distance, that can be used when we know for sure that there is only one medal in the quest. Fill in in your code in the function **single_heuristic** in the Python module informed_search.py. A* with this simple heuristic should find the optimal solution faster than uniform cost search for the quest described in questE.txt (139 nodes expanded vs 364 nodes for ucs). To get any credit on this question, your heuristic must be admissible and consistent.

	*python spartanquest.py questE.txt astar single_heuristic*

        Path length: 12
        Path cost: 30
        Number of nodes expanded: 139

3. A better heuristic to be used when we know for sure that there is only one medal in the quest. Fill in in your code in the function **better_heuristic** in the Python module informed_search.py. A* with this better heuristic
should find the optimal solution even faster for the quest described in questE.txt: less than 40 nodes expanded vs 326 nodes for ucs and 108 for single_heuristic. My implementation expands 26 nodes. Can you beat it? To get any credit on this question, your heuristic must be admissible and consistent.

	*python spartanquest.py questE.txt astar better_heuristic*

		Path length: 12
		Path cost: 30
		Number of nodes expanded: 26

4. A more general heuristic to be used when the maze contains an arbitrary number of medals and these medals can be anywhere in the maze. Fill in your code in the function **gen_heuristic** in the Python module informed_search.py. A* with this general heuristic should find the optimal solution faster for the quest described in questF.txt. Note that ucs expands 48,211 nodes for questF.txt. You will be graded based on how many nodes your heuristic expands. My implementation expands 2,427 nodes. Can you beat it?

	*python spartanquest.py questF.txt astar gen_heuristic*

		Path length: 73
		Path cost: 133
		Number of nodes expanded: 2,427

|Number of nodes expanded: | Grade |
| :------------: | :------------: |
| > 20,000  | 0  |
| <= 20,000  |  1 |
|  <= 15,000 |  2 |
| <= 2,500  |  3 |

If you implement gen_heuristic correctly, you should be able to use it to solve the quest described in questG.txt within a reasonable time frame and with less than 50,000 nodes expanded. Note that the ucs solution to that same maze expands 1,809,104 nodes and takes about 2 minutes on my laptop.

You should test your heuristic with ALL the quests provided (SJSU, questA through questI and noway). Make sure that you are getting the optimal solution in all these cases.** If you get a solution that is non optimal, this is an indication that your heuristic is not admissible or not consistent.**

**Please note that if your heuristic is not admissible or non-consistent, you will not get any credit, regardless of the number of nodes expanded.**

**Make sure that your heuristic is reducing the total compute time and not increasing it!**

Make sure you fill in the docstrings for the heuristics to explain what each of them does.

Feel free to implement and use any helper functions to keep your code readable.

Even though you need all the files to test your program, you only need to upload your solution in informed_search.py.

### IMPORTANT:

The various positions in the maze are expressed as a tuple: the first element of the tuple is the row and the second element is the column. The top left position is (0, 0). Rows increase as we move down and columns increase as we move right Â­ as shown below.
